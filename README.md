## Dependencies

- [Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Getting started

1. Check out this repo
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm build` to build the minified application

For development use, run a local server with `npm start`. This will automatically reroute all requests to a local AuthPlz instance running at `https://localhost:9000`.

## Usage

Pre-compiled packages are available [here](https://github.com/ryankurte/authplz-ui/releases) for tagged releases.

Precompiled or local development instances can be run against via authplz using `./authplz --static-dir=$(pwd)` (with the correct path to the authplz instance)
